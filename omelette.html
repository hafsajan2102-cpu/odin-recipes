    <h2><b> Description:</b></h2>
    <p>A simple and quick omelette can be made with just a few ingredients and a non-stick pan. This recipe is for a basic, diner-style omelette. 
</p>
    <h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 or 3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp water or milk (optional, for fluffiness)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter or oil</li>
        <li>Desired fillings</li>
     </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare the eggs:</b> Crack the eggs into a small bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper (and water or milk, if using). Whisk well with a fork until the whites and yolks are thoroughly combined and slightly frothy.</li>
        <li><b>Heat the pan:</b> Heat an 8-inch (20 cm) non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the butter or oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. The butter should be melted and foaming (but not browned) when you add the eggs.</li>
        <li><b>Cook the omelette:</b> Pour the egg mixture into the pan. As the edges begin to set (after about 10-20 seconds), use a rubber spatula to gently push the cooked portions toward the center of the pan. Tilt and rotate the pan to allow the uncooked egg to flow into the empty spaces at the edges.</li>
        <li><b>Add fillings:</b> Once the eggs are mostly set on the surface but still look moist and no visible liquid egg remains, sprinkle your desired fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li><b>Fold and serve:</b> Use the spatula to lift the unfilled side of the omelette and fold it over the filled half. Cook for another 30 seconds to a minute to warm the filling and melt the cheese.</li>
        <li><b>Plate the omelette:</b> Carefully slide the finished omelette onto a serving plate and serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
