    <h2><b> Description:</b></h2>
    <p>To cook a perfect, juicy steak with a caramelized crust, the best method is pan-searing in a hot, heavy-bottomed skillet (preferably cast iron) with butter, garlic, and herbs. </p>
    <h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 steaks (about 1–1.5 inches thick, e.g., ribeye, New York strip, or sirloin)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp high smoke-point oil (vegetable, canola, or extra light olive oil; avoid extra virgin olive oil)</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>11 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly smashed</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary or thyme (optional)</li>
     </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Bring to Room Temperature: </b> Remove the steaks from the refrigerator about 30–40 minutes before cooking to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li><b>Pat Dry and Season: </b>Thoroughly pat the steaks dry with paper towels. Moisture on the surface prevents a good sear. Season generously on all sides with salt and pepper just before cooking.</li>
        <li><b>Heat the Pan: </b> Heat a cast iron or heavy-bottomed stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until it is very hot and the oil is shimmering or just starting to smoke, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Sear the Steaks: </b> Carefully place the steaks in the hot pan (laying them away from you to avoid oil splatters). Press down gently to ensure full contact with the pan surface. Cook for 3–4 minutes on the first side without moving them, until a deep brown crust forms.</li>
        <li><b>Flip and Baste: </b> Flip the steaks. Reduce the heat to medium-low and immediately add the butter, smashed garlic, and herbs (if using) to the pan. Tilt the pan slightly so the butter pools to one side, and use a large spoon to continuously baste the melted butter over the steaks for about 1 minute or until they reach your desired doneness. Use tongs to sear the edges (especially the fatty side) for about a minute.</li>
        <li><b>Check Doneness: </b>Use an instant-read thermometer for precision. Remove the steaks from the pan when they are about 5–10°F below your target temperature, as they will continue to cook while resting. <br>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Medium-Rare: </b>Remove at 125°F (final temp 130°F–135°F)</li>
            <li><b>Medium: </b>Remove at 135°F (final temp 140°F–145°F)</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li><b>Rest the Steaks: </b>Transfer the steaks to a plate or cutting board and cover loosely with foil. Let them rest for 5–10 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, which keeps it moist.</li>
        <li><b>Serve: </b> Slice the steak against the grain and pour any remaining pan juices over the top before serving.</li>
    </ol>
